# Analysis of listening habits with Spotify

This project was made for a class in my 3rd year of college. The instructions were that we have to pick a project where we can get enough data to analyse with a suitable machine learning techique. I chose to analyse my Spotify data with clustering to see what I listen to, what the songs I listen to have in common and if they can be grouped based on their attributes.

The project was made in a Jupyter Notebook for easier display of findings and graphs. I used the Spotify API and Spotify for Developers.

More detailed description of the code is in the notebook.
